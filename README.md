> Because mixing drinks shouldn't feel like mixing up your codebase. 😅

Welcome to the **Cocktail Recipe Explorer**! 🍸 A project dedicated to helping you discover and save cocktail recipes without getting lost in the chaos of overwhelming collections online. Whether you're a beginner mixologist or a pro, this app will help you find your next drink with style and ease. 😎

## 💡 Problem
- Too many cocktail recipes out there? Yep. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack... if the haystack was made of mojitos and margaritas. 🏖️
- Beginners struggling to understand complicated recipes with no pictures? Let's fix that! 📸

## 🎯 Solution
A **responsive web application** that allows users to:
- Browse and discover cocktail recipes
- Search cocktails by name 🍸🔍
- Filter by alcohol type (vodka, rum, tequila…you name it) 🍹
- Save your favorite drinks (because who remembers that perfect martini from last week? 🧐)

## 🚀 MVP Features
### 🍹 **Recipe Browser**
- A grid of cocktail recipes, complete with images and names
- **Responsive design** for all screen sizes (even if you're viewing on your tiny phone screen! 📱)
- Toggle between **grid** and **list** views because variety is the spice of life, right?

### 🔎 **Search & Filter**
- **Search cocktails by name** – find that long-lost pina colada 🏖️
- Filter by **alcohol type** (vodka, rum, tequila... need we say more? 🥃)
- Filter by **alcoholic vs. non-alcoholic** – because sometimes, you need a mocktail. 🍸🚫

### 📜 **Recipe Details**
- **Ingredients** with precise measurements (no guessing, we got you covered! 🧑‍🍳)
- **Step-by-step instructions** so you don’t end up with a hot mess. 🔥
- Suggested **glass type** to serve your drink in 🥂 (because it’s all about presentation).
- A **photo of the final drink** because we all know it’s about what it looks like as much as what it tastes like. 🍹📸

### 🌟 **Favorites System**
- Save your **favorite recipes** to **local storage** (no need to memorize them anymore, phew).
- View and manage your saved cocktails in a dedicated section 🍸💾
- Remove recipes from favorites (if you’ve had too much of a particular drink. No judgment. 🤷‍♂️)

## 📡 API Selection
We’re using **The Cocktail Database API** for all your cocktail recipe needs. 🍹
- [API Documentation here](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Because we like to keep it simple and sweet like a mojito 🍃🍋)
- Fetch API (for those smooth cocktail requests 🍸)
- Local Storage (no one likes an empty fridge... or a forgotten drink recipe 🍺)
